QuranWord Insights (BETA)

# Introduction

You are one of the earliest testers of QuranWord Insights!

This extension enhances your experience on Quran.com by providing detailed word breakdowns, context analysis, and root word exploration with a single click.

This is a BETA release, so please report any issues or feedback!

# Background

This project builds upon the Quranic Arabic Corpus, a well-known linguistic resource originally developed by Dr. Kais Dukes in 2009. In 2023, Dr. Dukes began working on Quranic Corpus 2.0, a more advanced version of the original corpus, but sadly, he passed away in 2024 before its completion. The backend of this extension is based on a modified version of the Quranic Corpus 2.0 API, re-structuring its morphological breakdown and search capabilities.

Since the future of the Corpus 2.0 remains uncertain, this project aims to continue Dr. Dukes’ legacy by making the linguistic depth of the Quran more accessible to users of Quran.com. This extension is currently in BETA and open for feedback from early users.
